## JavaScript library to talk to Hackpad
Unlike current hackpad libraries, the aim here is to talk to hackpad through the
ace editor and not through the hackpad API which is limited.


# Prerequisites
- Node `apt-get install nodejs`

# Setup
Run `npm install`

# Cheatsheet

- Add an npm package: `npm install <package name> --save-dev` (assuming
  all npm packages are for dev tasks)
